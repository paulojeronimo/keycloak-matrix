*This project turns possible to register clients in Keycloak in an
automated way*. +
Here, {uri-keycloak}[Keycloak^] is managed by Docker. +
{uri-the-admin-cli}[The Admin CLI^] is invoked inside the created
container by `matrix-functions.sh` to create realms, and manage the
clients. +
Let's see how this works by following the next steps.

toc::[]

== Prerequisites

. Docker installed.
. A macOS or Linux operational system.

NOTE: This project was only tested on macOS 10.15.6 and Linux Ubuntu
20.04.1.

== Download the project and change the current directory

----
$ git clone https://github.com/paulojeronimo/keyckoak-matrix
$ cd `basedir $_`
----

== Turn the Matrix functions available in your shell

----
$ source functions.sh
----

. The line above will turn available the `matrix-*` functions in your
shell.
You can see what are these functions by typing the following command:
+
----
$ set | grep ^matrix- | sort
----
+
. It will also put a line inside your `~/.bashrc` or `~./bash_profile`
  (depend on with OS you are using) with will automatically load this
script for you. You can check this by running the following command:
+
----
$ [[ $OSTYPE =~ darwin ]] && profile=~/.bash_profile || profile=~/.bashrc
$ grep functions $profile
----

== Start the Matrix

----
$ matrix-create
----

. You can now open http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/ and log in using
the credentials configured in `config.sh`. The credentails are
configured by two shell variables: `MATRIX_ADMIN_USER` and
`MATRIX_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
.. The `config.sh` is a copy of the file `config.sample.sh`
with your own configurations (and it is ignored by Git).
. The `matrix-create` function will start a Keycloak docker container.
This container will be an instance of the image configured in the file
`config.sh`. The docker image (and the created container) can be
checked by the following commands:
+
----
$ docker images | grep keycloak
$ docker container ls | grep keycloak
----
. You can also use the `matrix-status` function to discover if Keycloak
  is started.
+
----
$ matrix-status
----
. Wait until Keycloak is started! You can check the logs by using the
  command `docker logs -f keycloak` until you see a line like this:
+
----
00:57:26,386 INFO  [org.jboss.as] (Controller Boot Thread) WFLYSRV0051:
Admin console listening on http://127.0.0.1:9990
----

== Run the sample apps

=== Plain JavaScript

==== Starting and configuring Keycloak

----
$ matrix-project-add samples/plain-js/
----
. The `matrix-project-add` function will add the specified project.
.. A project is a directory containing a file called
`matrix-functions.sh`.
The function with suffix `-project-add` (inside this file) will be
called automatically.

==== Starting the webapp

----
$ samples/plain-js/serve.sh &
----

. This will start a local server listening on port 3000 and serving the
  directory link:plain-js/webapp[] which contains an static
HTML file called `index.html`.

----
$ open http://localhost:3000
----
. If you are using Linux, type `xdg-open` in place of `open` in the
  command above.
. You will need to register an new user. After that you will be
  automatically redirected to the app, as a logged user.
